## :innocent: Motivation

The main motivation of doing this research is to present a heart disease
prediction model for the prediction of occurrence of heart disease. Further, this
research work is aimed towards identifying the best classification algorithm for
identifying the possibility of heart disease in a patient. This work is justified by
performing a comparative study and analysis using **5 Classification algorithms**
namely `SVC (Support Vector Classifier), KNeighbors, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest` are used at different levels of
evaluations. Although these are commonly used machine learning algorithms, the
heart disease prediction is a vital task involving highest possible accuracy. Hence, the
five algorithms are evaluated at numerous levels and types of evaluation strategies.
This will provide researchers and medical practitioners to establish a better..

## :star: Features

- **GUI Support:** GUI support is adding to take input using Tkinter.
- **Support for detection of Heart Disease:** our model is able to detect Whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.

## :warning: Frameworks and Libraries

- **[SKLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/):** Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
- **[Joblibs](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):**
  Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust on large data in particular and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) :** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **[Numpy](https://numpy.org/):**
  Caffe-based Single Shot-Multibox Detector (SSD) model used to detect faces
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):**
  pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

## :book: Data Preprocessing

Data pre-processing is an important step for the creation of a machine learning
model. Initially, data may not be clean or in the required format for the model which
can cause misleading outcomes. In pre-processing of data, we transform data into our
required format. It is used to deal with noises, duplicates, and missing values of the
dataset. Data pre-processing has the activities like importing datasets, splitting
datasets, attribute scaling, etc. Preprocessing of data is required for improving the
accuracy of the model.

## :link: Download

The dataset is now available [here](heart.csv)  ! 

## :key: Prerequisites
